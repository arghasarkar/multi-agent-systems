# Agent based systems

The aim of this project is to design three intelligent agents taking part in three different types of auctions; each 
with their own rules. In these auctions, three are paintings by different artists. The cost of all paintings by a given
artist is the same. However, the cost of paintings by different artists vary. The rules for winning the auctions are 
different.

There are 3 types of auctions:

1) **Five of a kind:** Acquire 5 paintings by the same artist. The order of the paintings being auctioned is known.

2) **Five of a kind (order unknown):** Acquire 5 paintings by the same artist where the order of each painting being 
auctioned is unknown.

3) **Highest value of paintings:** The overall winner is the person with the highest cumulative value of all the acquired 
paintings.

4) **Highest value of paintings (second price auction):** The overall winner is the person with the highest cumulative 
value of all the acquired paintings. At each round, the highest bidder wins but pays the second highest bid.
